## I'm Pan ðŸ‘‹

I'm interested in open-source, language design, bare-metal computing, and virtual machines and sharing authentic knowledge, failures and epiphanies in all their glory. I'm generally happy coding in Rust, Ocaml, and Lisp.

I was the author and core maintainer of [RxGo](https://github.com/reactivex/rxgo).
I'm currently working on [Monet](https://github.com/monetlang).

Besides programming, I'm passionate about self-improvement, productive mindset, and positive work environment. You should read some of my insights below:
